# Concourse CI Teams Resource

Sends messages to [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) from
within [Concourse CI](https://concourse.ci) pipelines.

Implements the Microsoft Teams
[Connector](https://dev.outlook.com/Connectors/Reference) protocols and
the Concourse CI [resource](https://concourse.ci/implementing-resources.html)
protocols.

Resolves at runtime Concourse CI environment variables referenced in your Teams
connector messages such as:

```
$BUILD_ID
$BUILD_NAME
$BUILD_JOB_NAME
$BUILD_PIPELINE_NAME
$BUILD_TEAM_NAME
$ATC_EXTERNAL_URL
```

## STATUS

## TODO

* Make `potentialAction` button/link optional


## SETUP

1. Open the Microsoft Teams UI.
2. Identify the channel you wish to post notifications to - ie: #devops....
3. Open the "more options" menu of that channel and select "Connectors".

4. Select "Incoming Webhook" and respond to the propts for details like the
icon and name of the connector.

5. Use the webhook url from above in your pipeline `source` definition.  The
example below creates an `alert` resource.  Each point in the pipeline labeled
`alert` is a Microsoft Teams Connector message.
